# Covid-19 Basic Analysis

Analysis of the evolution of the number of deaths caused by Covid-19 in Spain.

The dataset used is obtained from the declaration of Covid-19 cases to the spanish National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) through the platform SiViES, managed by the National Epidemiology Center (CNE).

The dataset **"casos_hosp_uci_def_sexo_edad_provres.csv"** has the following features:

provincia_iso (ISO code of the province)

- sexo (gender)
- grupo_edad (age group)
- fecha (date)
- num_casos (number of infected with confirmation test)
- num_hosp (hospitalizations)
- num_uci (admitted to ICU)
- num_def (deaths)

This exercise is part of my journey toward Data Science and ML Engineering.
